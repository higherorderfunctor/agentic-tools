# Target-subshell shape gate — keeps errexit ARMED inside the update
# pipeline's per-target bodies.
#
# Bash disables errexit for any command whose status it tests: an `if`
# condition, a `while`/`until` condition, a `!` negation, or the left side of
# `||`/`&&`. That suppression reaches INSIDE a subshell and overrides a
# `set -e` written in the subshell itself. So this shape is a trap:
#
#     if ! ( set -euETo pipefail; false; echo REACHED ); then   # REACHED runs
#
# while this one is safe:
#
#     set +e; ( set -euETo pipefail; false; echo REACHED ); rc=$?   # rc=1
#
# The update pipeline used the trap shape from at least 2026-04-13 to
# 2026-09-09. Every bare command in a target body fell through to the
# trailing `git commit`, whose success became the target's exit status, so a
# nixpkgs bump whose build verification FAILED shipped as `UPDATED` on every
# sweep — measured on run 34351134945, which logged `UPDATED: nixpkgs` with
# zero `HELD BACK:` lines in 12,274 lines of log.
#
# Prose did not hold. The rule was written into a fragment and then broken
# twice inside two days, each time caught only by a reviewer. shellcheck has
# no diagnostic for it (CLAUDE.md says so explicitly), which is why this
# exists as a build-failing check rather than a review obligation.
#
# WHY THIS CHECK IS A GREP AND NOT A LINTER. Deciding "which failures in this
# body must abort" is a judgement call and any scanner for it needs a
# suppression marker per false positive. Deciding "is this subshell in a
# status-tested context" is syntax. Fixing the SHAPE makes errexit the
# default for every command in the body, so the only thing left to check is
# the shape — one grep, no markers, no drift.
