#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Steering symlink probe. Does v3 DROP a symlinked steering file (like hooks) or
# FOLLOW it (like agents/skills)? Self-contained: builds a workspace rig with a
# real steering file (control) + a symlinked one, both `inclusion: always`, and
# reads which kiro actually loaded via `/context show` (the decisive
# loaded-vs-not signal — no model-recite ambiguity).
#
# ANSWER AS OF 2.21.4 (re-run 2026-09-12): it FOLLOWS. Both the real control and
# the symlink are listed by `/context show`. The behaviour CHANGED at some point
# after 2.13.0, where this probe originally recorded a drop; do not read the old
# conclusion as current. Re-run on a Kiro bump rather than trusting either.
#
# Global steering is NOT covered here — no saved script tests it. To cover it,
# place a symlinked file in the REAL ~/.kiro/steering and run in a neutral cwd
# (additive, trap-cleaned — mirror probe-global-realhome.sh).
