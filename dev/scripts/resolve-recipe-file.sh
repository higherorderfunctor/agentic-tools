# dev/scripts/resolve-recipe-file.sh — deterministic recipe-file
# resolution for the update pipeline. Sourced by update-common.sh (and
# thus update-pkg.sh) and by checks/packaging/update-targets-parity.nix.
#
# Single-function library. It enables the repo-wide strict mode on source
# (set -euETo pipefail + inherit_errexit, lines below) — a deliberate
# top-level effect, consistent with every strict-mode caller — and defines no
# other top-level state, so it is safe to source anywhere (script, test
# harness, nix sandbox).

# resolve_recipe_file <git-url> <recipe-root> [recipe-root ...]
#
# Print, on stdout, the single recipe .nix file that pins the upstream
# repo named by <git-url>. Return 0 on exactly one match; return 1 with a
# diagnostic on stderr for zero or multiple matches.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the previous resolution was
#     repo_name=$(basename-of-url)                    # e.g. "context7"
#     target_file=$(grep -rl "$repo_name" overlays | head -1)
# which matched ANY file merely mentioning the bare repo basename —
# including unrelated overlays naming it in a comment (effect-mcp.nix
# carries "Mirrors context7-mcp.nix.") — and `head -1` over grep -r's
# streamed, unordered output is a race that resolves to different files
# on different runs/hosts. That silently rewrote the wrong overlay:
# context7's HEAD rev was written into effect-mcp's fetch block, pinning
# a nonexistent tim-smart/effect-mcp commit → source 404 → red CI.
#
# The upstream repo's *identity* already lives unambiguously in the fetch
# block. Match on that, in either supported form:
#   - fetchFromGitHub { owner = "<owner>"; repo = "<repo>"; ... }
#   - fetchgit        { url = "...github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git"; ... }
# and require exactly one match, so an ambiguous/missing mapping fails
# loudly (HELD BACK) instead of silently corrupting a sibling recipe.
